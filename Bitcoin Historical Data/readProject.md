üìÅ About Dataset

Bitcoin is the longest running and most well known cryptocurrency, first released as open source in 2009 by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.
Bitcoin serves as a decentralized medium of digital exchange, with transactions verified and recorded in a public distributed ledger without the need for a trusted record keeping authority or central intermediary.

CSV files for select bitcoin exchanges for the time period of Jan 2012 to December March 2021, with minute to minute updates of OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close), Volume in BTC and indicated currency, and weighted bitcoin price.
Timestamps are in Unix time. Timestamps without any trades or activity have their data fields filled with NaNs. If a timestamp is missing, or if there are jumps, this may be because the exchange (or its API) was down, the exchange (or its API) did not exist, or some other unforeseen technical error in data reporting or gathering. 
All effort has been made to deduplicate entries and verify the contents are correct and complete to the best of my ability, but obviously trust at your own risk.
